                What is the best place to stay in the Bahamas? Well,
                thats a tough question considering every island of the Bahamas is unique,
                which means that when planning a trip to this slice of paradise,
                youll want to know exactly what you want to get out of your holiday.</p>

            <p>Tough doesnt mean that it is impossible to answer, however.
                To figure it out, well first need to learn more about the
                most popular islands in the Bahamas, a tropical archipelago made up of 700 islands
                and cays. Note that not all the islands are inhabitable, which does in a way make
                your decision a little easier.</p>
